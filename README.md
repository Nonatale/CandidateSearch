  ## Description
  I built this project to have a better understanding of React, specifically using useState and useEffect to update web application elements. The application will generate a number of github users upon page load. The user will be able to view these users and save them in local storage.

  ## Installation
  The user will need to include their own GitHub Personal Access Token in the .env file. Then they can run 'npm run dev' to start the application in localhost.
  
  ## Usage
  Use the 'Next Candidate' and 'Save Candidate' button to save/skip the github profiles. The user will be able to see the saved users under 'Potential Candidates'.
